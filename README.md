# Plate Calculator

Demo: https://plate-calculator.herokuapp.com/

This app helps lifters calculate plates to put on the barbel.

The app can run in two modes: `single` and `range`.

- For `single` mode, you enter a weight and it helps you calculate how many plates needed.
- For `range` mode, you enter a range of number, and it helps you calculate how many plates to put on for each number.

How to run the app?

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn
# go the root folder, then run
node app.js
```
