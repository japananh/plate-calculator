# Plate Calculator

This app helps lifters calculate plates to put on the barbel.

There are two modes: `single` and `range`.

- For `single` mode, you enter a weight and it helps you calculate how many plates needed.
- For `range` mode, you enter a range of number, and it helps you calculate how many plates to put on for each number.
